# Well come to my blog


  Hello ,I am Jean Baptiste HABANABAKIZE ,and this is my personal journey mastering **R** and **Python** for Data analytics.

We will be comparing the codes so as to master R and Python at time.Python differs from R and both are unique.Let as the example bellow.
We start by laoding  the data into these languages . # with Python we start by head.df() and with R we write a head(df)

### Python Example
```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
df.head()    
````
### R Example

```r
df <- read.csv("data.csv")
head(df)
````
In order to master the two, I take this initiative to make the course  bellow.
Note: Each module includes hands-on exercises, mini-projects, and comparative examples between Python and R to reinforce concepts and prepare you for real-world data analysis.
You will work with both R and Python throughout the course, following my examples and creating your own exercises. 
###The goal is to **develop your skills actively and avoid relying solely on AI**. Mastering these languages requires *consistent effort and practice*.

# Module 0: Introduction to Programming Concepts

Welcome to the first module of our R & Python curriculum! This module introduces the core programming concepts.
## 0.1 Variables, Constants, and Data Types



###**Variables and Values in Python and R**


A **variable** is a symbolic name that stores data in memory. You can think of it as a **labeled container** for a value.  

- **Python:** Variables are dynamically typed; you donâ€™t need to declare their type explicitly.assignment uses  only `=`
- **R:** Variables are also dynamically typed, but assignment uses `<-`(Preffered) or `=`. 

---

A **value** is the actual data stored inside a variable.  In both R and Python, text values (strings) are written inside quotation marks.
You can use either double quotes "" or single quotes ''.
Numbers, like 25 or 3.14, are written without quotes. Text must be inside quotes to be recognized as a string.
For example:
In Python 
```python
age = 25             # age is the variable, 25 is the value
name = "Jean"        # name is the variable, "Jean" is the value (text/string)
```
In R 
```r
name1 <- "Alice"
name2 <- 'Bob'
```

### Data Types in Python and R

**Numeric:** integers/floats 

Python: `x = 10`  `y = 3.14`  
R: `x <- 10`  `y <- 3.14`  

**String/Character:** text in quotes (`""` or `''`)  
Python: `name = "Jean"`  
R: `name <- "Jean"`  

**Boolean/Logical:** True/False values  
Python: `is-the name Jean = True`  
R: `is-the name Jean  <- TRUE`  

**Constants:** values that do not change  
Python: `PI = 3.1416`  # convention: All have to be written in papital letters  
R: `PI <- 3.1416`     # no strict constant type

##  0.2 Expressions, Operators, and Precedence

### Arithmetic Operators
Perform basic math operations. The only difference is on *exponentiation*
- Python: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**` (exponentiation)  
- R: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^` (exponentiation)  

**Examples:** 
For Python 
```python
a = 5
b = 2
sum = a + b       # 7
power = a ** b    # 25   
```
---------
For R
```r
a <- 5
b <- 2
sum <- a + b      # 7
power <- a ^ b    # 25
```
